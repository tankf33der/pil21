         Micro-Templates

* Each template file in the @lib/xhtml/ directory applies to one type of
  component in the @lib/xhtml.l functions.

* The template files are line oriented. One micro-template per line.

* A micro-template can be continued on the following line(s) by indenting these
  lines with space(s).

* Each line has a defined meaning. Except for indented lines, no lines can be
  added or removed.

* A micro-template consists of a defined number of parts, separated by "@". The
  number of parts depends on the micro-template. As a consequence, any "@" in
  the text must be encoded as "%40".

* An empty line is denoted by "<>".

* "~" is replaced at runtime with the session ID.

* At program start, all templates from @lib/xhtml/ are loaded.

* The application may override one or more files in a local directory.
  Also more than once.
